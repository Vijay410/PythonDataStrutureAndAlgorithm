# 📘 Day-02: Array Insert & Delete Operations (DSA)

This document covers my **Day-02 learning and revision** on **Array insertion and deletion**, focusing on **how operations work internally** and **why time complexity is O(n)**.

---

## 🎯 Today’s Goal

- Understand how **insertion** works internally
- Understand how **deletion** works internally
- Learn why array insert/delete operations take **O(n)** time

---

## 🔹 What is an Insert Operation?

An **insert operation** means adding a new element into an array at a specific position:
- Beginning
- Middle
- End

---

## 📌 Insert Operations in Array

### 🔹 Insert at END
- No shifting of elements is required
- Fastest insert operation
- **Time Complexity: O(1)** (if space is available)
